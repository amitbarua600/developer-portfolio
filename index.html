                    I am the master of HTML, CSS and Javascript. I know everything needed to make a website function,
                    efficient.
                    I didn't stop with the web. I went beyond with most popular Javascript framework called Vue JS. I
                    even
                    know
                    the deployment, server and security. I will give you 100% web solution.

                    They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web developer. I made their website and
                    showed
                    it
                    to them. They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming.
